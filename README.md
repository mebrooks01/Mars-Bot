# Mars Bot Documentation

Mars Bot is an open-source discord bot developed by [Mebrooks01#3354](https://github.com/mebrooks01)\
You can add it to your server with [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760605516384305224&scope=bot&permissions=1141242945). If you have any questions you can join [our discord server](https://discord.gg/yKnBYJE).

Mars Bot uses NASA's API and other sources to give you plenty of cool information about missions and even look at the weather on Mars (when NASA/JPL-Caltech decides to give the data to the API).

## Self Hosting

If you would like to host the bot yourself, you are more than welcome. If you have questions on how to do any of these steps, you should not be self hosting. I will only be walking through the process for Windows 10. You will need **node.js** and **git** to run this bot on your own. You can get node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and git [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Cloning and Dependency

Open a new terminal (CMD, Powershell, etc) in a folder.\
Clone the repository and navigate to it.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/mebrooks01/Mars-Bot

```

Then install its dependencies.
